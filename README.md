## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify preview website](https://rjrr-fem-social-links-profile.netlify.app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learned how to use pseudo-elements to create some hover effects
- I learned how to set a dark mode and how to change the theme through an accessible toggle button
- I learned some use cases for some accessibility HTML attributes such as `aria-label`, `role`, `aria-expanded` and `aria-checked`


### Continued development

Improving at using semantic HTML tags and creating more accesible components

### Useful resources

- [Accessible switch button Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/) - This helped me create a more accessible toggle button for the dark mode
- [How to make a website light/dark toggle with CSS & JS](https://youtu.be/wodWDIdV9BY?si=2gNiT2AZJaX-cPC1) - I used this resource to create the logic behind the CSS clases for the dark mode.
- [Buttons With Awesome Hover Effects Using Only HTML & CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLfAW55_4cY) - I take the idea for the social media links' hover effect from this video.
